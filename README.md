# Google Search Front-End

This project implements a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. It provides a simplified version of Google's interface and allows users to perform searches and access search results.

## Pages

The project consists of the following three HTML pages:

1. `index.html` - Google Search Page: Allows users to enter a search query and perform a Google search.
2. `image.html` - Google Image Search Page: Allows users to enter a search query and perform a Google Image search.
3. `advanced.html` - Google Advanced Search Page: Allows users to enter advanced search criteria based on Google's own advanced search options.

## Usage

To use the front-end, simply open the desired HTML page in a web browser. You can click on the links provided to navigate between different search pages. Here's how each page works:

### Google Search Page

- Enter your search query in the search bar.
- Click the "Google Search" button to perform a Google search.
- Click the "I'm Feeling Lucky" link to directly access the first search result.

### Google Image Search Page

- Enter your image search query in the search bar.
- Click the "Google Image Search" button to perform a Google Image search.

### Google Advanced Search Page

- Enter search criteria in the respective fields:
  - "Find pages with... all these words": Enter words that must be present on the pages.
  - "Find pages with... this exact word or phrase": Enter an exact word or phrase to search for.
  - "Find pages with... any of these words": Enter words that can be present on the pages.
  - "Find pages with... none of these words": Enter words that should not be present on the pages.
- Click the "Advanced Search" button to perform a Google search with the specified criteria.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the CSS styles in the `styles.css` file to match your preferences or to resemble Google's aesthetics further. You can also modify the layout and design of the HTML pages as needed.
