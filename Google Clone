# Google Search Front-End

This project implements a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. It provides a simplified version of Google's interface and allows users to perform searches and access search results.

## Description

The Google Search Front-End is a web application that emulates the functionality and aesthetics of Google's search interface. It consists of three HTML pages: Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. Each page allows users to enter their search queries and perform the corresponding searches.

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates the usage of HTML forms, GET parameters, and basic CSS styling to create a user-friendly search experience.

## Pages

The project includes the following HTML pages:

1. `index.html` - Google Search Page: Allows users to enter a search query and perform a Google search.
2. `image.html` - Google Image Search Page: Allows users to enter a search query and perform a Google Image search.
3. `advanced.html` - Google Advanced Search Page: Allows users to enter advanced search criteria based on Google's own advanced search options.
